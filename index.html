      <h2>What Is Mindfulness?</h2>
      <img id="mindful-img" class="img-right" src="images/mindful.jpeg" alt="Illustration of a
      figure and their dog. The figure has many things on mind. The dog is in
      the present moment.">
      <p>
        Mindfulness can be described as the state of being aware of one's
        feelings and emotions while at the same time being conscious of
        one's surroundings in the present moment. Importantly, this state is
        achieved by accepting and relinquishing judgement of everything
        within the present moment; including emotions, physical sensations,
        and physical surroundings.

      <h4>How You Can Start Living Mindfully</h4>
      <p>
        To live mindfully, it is helpful to establish a daily formal
        meditation practice. Meditation often involves sitting and bringing
        one's attention to the present moment for a period of time. There
        are several variations of the practice that use different techniques
        to develop mindfulness. Visit the <a href="one.html">Meditation</a>
        page to learn more.
        <br>
        Some other ways to develop mindfulness include doing "nothing",
        practising gratitiude, and thoughtfully consuming media. These three
        topics are covered in detail on the <a href="two.html">Mindful
        Living Practices</a> page.
