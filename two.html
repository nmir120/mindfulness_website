      <h1>Mindful Living Practices</h1>
      <p>
        Apart from meditation, there are numerous ways to develop mindfulness.
        This page will discuss three of my favourite mindful living practices:
        doing "nothing", gratitude, and thoughtful media consumption.
      </p>
      <h2>Doing "Nothing"</h2>
      <img id="bench-img" class="img-right" src="images/bench.jpg" alt="Man sitting on park bench">
      <p>
        This isn’t exactly as simple as it sounds, though it is by no means
        difficult. If you think meditation is too challenging, try starting off
        by doing nothing. This is a practice that involves finding a space to
        sit down and letting your mind do whatever it pleases. The only rule is
        that if you notice that you are consciously trying to do something
        (e.g., pushing away a thought or feeling, forcing yourself to think
        happy thoughts, etc.), let go of this effort. I would recommend starting
        off with 10 minutes per session and working your way up to 20 minutes.
        <br>
        <br>
        This practice is so great because it lets you...    
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          naturally gain a better understanding of the nature of thoughts (their
          flow and impermanence),
        </li>
        <li>
          settle down your mind so you can think more clearly, and
        </li>
        <li>
          understand that you do not need to act on certain thoughts or feelings; they pass on their own.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="clr-r">Gratitude</h2>
      <img id="grat-img" class="img-right" src="images/grat.jpeg" alt="A journal with the writing 'I am grateful for' written on empty page">
      <p>
        Multiple studies have shown that people who practise some form of
        gratitude lead happier lives. In our “default” day-to-day thinking, we
        tend to always be on the pursuit to achieve. “I need to get this thing,
        then I will <em>finally</em> be happy!” How many times have you convinced yourself of
        this? This type of thinking is simply misleading. You get the thing that
        you wanted, there’s a temporary sense of achievement and satisfaction,
        and then the next moment your eyes shift to another prize to
        pursue. 
        <br>
        <br>
        By practising gratitude, you learn to appreciate what you
        already have in the present moment. This type of mindfulness shifts your
        thinking to come from a place of abundance rather than a place of lack.
        You may find yourself no longer needing things you previously thought
        were essential, and better yet, you will find yourself experiencing joy
        from things you previously paid no mind to. Here are two ways to
        practise gratitude:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>Sticky notes:</em>  You can write simple messages such as
          “What are you grateful for, right now?” or “Where can you find joy in
          the present moment?” on sticky notes and place them throughout your
          house. Every time you pass by one of these notes, make the conscious
          effort to answer the question.
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>Daily or weekly brief reflection:</em> At the beginning or
          end of every day (or every week), take a few minutes to write out what
          you are grateful for. This could be absolutely anything; there are no
          rules. Just write down whatever comes to mind and encourage the
          feeling of gratitude to grow.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 class="clr-r">Mindful Consumption of Media</h2>
      <h4>Dangers of Social Media</h4>
      <img id="media-img" class="img-left" src="images/soc-med.jpeg" alt="Boy cowering away from floating social media icons">
      <p>
        Do you compare yourself to others more often than you’d like? Are you
        unsatisfied with your achievements? Do you feel the constant need to
        prove yourself to others? Do you think the world is doomed? If you are
        answering yes to any of these questions, social media may be a culprit
        to your problems. Some platforms such as Instagram and Facebook are
        undoubtedly great at keeping you connected with friends and family and
        can provide entertainment during times of boredom, though, it is easy to
        dismiss the negative effects that these platforms might have on your
        mind. Naturally, as you scroll through these apps, you’ll find yourself
        looking at other people’s online personas, which you may have convinced
        yourself are accurate depictions of real people. You might wonder why
        others’ lives are so great and why yours is so boring. This type of
        thinking is the antagonist to the gratitude we discussed earlier.
        <br>
        <br>
        You should also be aware of the negativity bias on social media
        platforms. That is, negative events overshadow positive events, even if
        there are just as many impactful positive events as there are negative
        ones. Which of the following news is more likely to go viral? An athlete
        donating to help build a school for deaf children, or a musician being
        murdered in a random street shooting. With this biased nature of media,
        we are quicker to form an overall negative image of the world, which is
        likely to have numerous negative effects on our well-being and
        mindfulness, such as distrusting strangers, stereotyping, and lacking
        faith in humanity.

      <p>
        Firstly, it is wise to be mindful of how much time you spend on social
        media. These platforms tend to be designed in a way to keep you hooked
        so you spend as much time as possible browsing them. Now that you are
        aware of the negativity bias, next time you see good news online, take a
        moment to let it sink in and fully appreciate it. Secondly, look for and
        follow media that promotes mindfulness and related teachings. For
        example, one of my favourite podcasts is called “Secular Buddhism” by
        Noah Rasheta. Each episode discusses ideas from Buddhism and educates
        the listener on how they can apply mindful living principles to their
        own lives (the podcast does not require or even suggest that you become
        a Buddhist). Instead of hopping onto Instagram first thing in the
        morning, I made it a habit to plug in my earphones and listen to this
        podcast instead and it has done wonders for my mental well-being and my
        ability to act mindfully throughout the day. If you are interested, visit
        the Secular Buddhism website
        <a target="_blank" href="https://secularbuddhism.com/">here</a> to start listening.
        <br>
        <br>
        <em>Mindfulness Bot</em>
        <br>
        To help you maintain mindfulness throughout your day, I’ve built a simple
        Twitter bot that tweets out a random mindfulness-related quote every hour. If
        you have the app downloaded on your phone, you can follow the bot and turn on
        account notifications to have the tweets sent to your lock screen. You can
        visit the bot by clicking <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/bot_mindfulness">here</a>.
