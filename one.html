      <h1>What Is Meditation and How Does It Make You More Mindful?</h1>
      <img class="img-right" src="images/meditation.jpeg">
      <p>
        Meditation is a practice in which an individual uses a set of techniques
        to develop control over their attention and awareness, by focusing on
        elements of the present moment. Meditating, in a sense, is like taking a
        moment to step out of the everlasting mental race that goes on in your
        head. It’s about taking time to observe and learn from thought patterns
        rather than be reactive to them. Through this process, you directly and
        indirectly gain new perspectives about your thinking habits, which will
        make you more mindful of them. 
        <br>
        <br>
        With this boosted mindfulness, you are
        better equipped to respond more efficiently to various situations you
        encounter in your daily life. For instance, perhaps after meditating for
        some time and developing mindfulness, you might realize that you don’t
        even enjoy your morning coffee and that it makes you anxious and
        jittery, so you stop drinking coffee and save a few dollars every day
        (based on a true story!).

      <h2>Guided Meditation</h2>
      <p>
        Guided meditations are a great way to dip your toes in the water and
        get a feel for what meditation is like. Typically, these meditations
        consist of a voice recording in which the listener is guided into
        present-moment awareness, then instructed to bring their attention
        to a particular “object”, which is commonly the sensations produced
        by their own breathing. Intermittently, the recording prompts the
        listener to redirect their attention back to the object of focus if
        their mind has wandered. These recordings are often accompanied with
        a calming sound track. There are countless guided meditations
        available online, many of them completely free. Guided meditations
        also come in various themes, which is great for targeting specific
        problem areas that you may be experiencing (e.g., grief,
        relationship stress, injuries). Two fantastic apps that have a wide
        selection of guided meditations programs are Headspace and Calm.
