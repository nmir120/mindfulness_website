      <h1>What Is Meditation and How Does It Make You More Mindful?</h1>
      <img class="img-right" src="images/meditation.jpeg" alt="An individual practising seated meditation with a scenic background">
      <p>
        Meditation is a practice in which an individual uses a set of techniques
        to develop control over their attention and awareness, by focusing on
        elements of the present moment. Meditating, in a sense, is like taking a
        moment to step out of the everlasting mental race that goes on in your
        head. It's about taking time to observe and learn from thought patterns
        rather than be reactive to them. Through this process, you directly and
        indirectly gain new perspectives about your thinking habits, which will
        make you more mindful of them. 
        <br>
        <br>
        With this boosted mindfulness, you are
        better equipped to respond more efficiently to various situations you
        encounter in your daily life. For instance, perhaps after meditating for
        some time and developing mindfulness, you might realize that you don't
        even enjoy your morning coffee and that it makes you anxious and
        jittery, so you stop drinking coffee and save a few dollars every day
        (based on a true story!).
      </p>
      <h2>Guided Meditation</h2>
      <p>
        Guided meditations are a great way to dip your toes in the water and get
        a feel for what meditation is like. Typically, these meditations consist
        of a voice recording in which the listener is guided into present-moment
        awareness, then instructed to bring their attention to a particular
        "object", which is commonly their own breath. Intermittently, the
        recording prompts the listener to redirect their attention back to the
        object of focus if their mind has wandered. These recordings are often
        accompanied with a calming soundtrack. There are countless guided
        meditations available online, many of them completely free. Guided
        meditations also come in various themes, which is great for targeting
        specific problems that you may be experiencing (e.g., grief,
        relationship stress, injuries). Two fantastic apps that have a wide
        selection of guided meditation programs are Headspace and Calm.

      <h2>Breathing-Focused Meditation (Self-Guided)</h2>
      <p>
        This style of meditation is basic, yet deeply rewarding. As you might guess
        by the name of it, in this practice, the meditator brings their
        attention to their breathing. More specifically, focus is placed on the
        <em>sensations</em> produced by breathing, for example, at the opening of the
        dominant nostril. So why should you use this technique? Firstly, as this
        practice is self-guided, you will not be interrupted by a guided voice
        recording, allowing you to sink deeper into a concentrated state.
        Secondly, the breath is a staple object to train your attention with; it
        is always present and it provides enough stimulation for you to keep
        your mind busy. Below, I have outlined eight simple steps you can take to
        begin a breathing-focused meditation session.
      </p>
      <img id="breath-img" class="img-left" src="images/breath.jpeg" alt="Illustration of a man meditating with a focus on the breath">
      <ol>
        <li>
          Decide how long you would like to meditate and set your timer or
          alarm. For beginners, I would recommend a daily 10-15 minute session.
          You can increment the length of your sessions over time to eventually
          sit for 45 minutes to one hour long sessions, which is recommended for
          deep concentration and mindfulness development.
        </li>
        <li>
          Find a comfortable sitting position where you can keep your spine tall
          (try sitting at the end of your chair, where your hips are at a higher
          level than your knees).
        </li>
        <li>
          Gently close your eyes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Become aware of your physical surroundings (sounds, smells,
          temperature, etc.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Become aware of your bodily sensations (heaviness, warmth, coolness,
          tension, softness, etc.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Start to bring your attention to the breathing sensations throughout
          your body (expanding and contracting of the ribs and abdomen, rise and
          fall of the shoulders, etc.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Narrow your focus to the breathing sensations at the tip of your nose,
          wherever the sensations are the clearest.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep your attention here, while maintaining a gentle awareness of your
          body and your surroundings.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <em>Know this: your attention will wander, over and over and over
        again.</em> Be diligent and patient. Gently redirect your attention to
        the object of focus each time you notice your mind wandering and soon
        your mind will learn to do this on its own. To keep the mind engaged
        with the breathing sensations at the nose, try to silently note both of
        the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          the length of the pauses between the inhale and the exhale, and
        </li>
        <li>
          the exact moment each breath begins and ends (both the inhales and the exhales).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Learn More</h4>
      <p>
        To learn more about breathing-focused meditation and many other
        meditation practices, I highly recommend the book "The Mind Illuminated"
        by John Yates. This book breaks down meditation into ten distinct
        stages, from beginner level to advanced, and explains in detail how to
        excel in your practice and get the most benefits.
