          <h1>What Is Mindfulness?</h1>
          <p>
            Mindfulness can be described as the state of being aware of one's feelings and emotions while at the same time being conscious of one's surroundings in the present moment. 
            Importantly, this state is achieved by accepting and relinquishing judgement of everything within the present moment; including emotions, physical sensations, and physical surroundings.

          <h3>Benefits of Mindfulness</h3>
          <p>
            People who practice living mindfully experience:
            <ul>
              <li>Lower levels of stress</li>
              <li>Increased satisfaction in relationships</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h3>How You Can Start Living Mindfully</h3>
          <p>
            To live mindfully, it is helpful to establish a daily formal meditation practice. Meditation typically involves sitting and bringing one's attention to the present moment for a timed period. There are several variations of the practice that use different
            techniques to develop mindfulness. Some require conscious effort, others don't. Click here to learn how to do two of my favourite meditation practices.
