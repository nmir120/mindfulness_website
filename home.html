          <h2>What Is Mindfulness?</h2>
          <p>
            Mindfulness can be described as the state of being aware of one's feelings and emotions while at the same time being conscious of one's surroundings in the present moment. 
            Importantly, this state is achieved by accepting and relinquishing judgement of everything within the present moment; including emotions, physical sensations, and physical surroundings.
          </p>
          <h2>Benefits of Mindfulness</h2>
          <p>
            People who practice living mindfully experience:
            <ul>
              <li>decreased levels of stress and anxiety,</li>
              <li>increased sense of peace and joy,</li>
              <li>improved emotional control,</li>
              <li>improved sleep quality,</li>
              <li>increased satisfaction in relationships, and</li>
              <li>much more!</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h2>How You Can Start Living Mindfully</h2>
          <p>
            To live mindfully, it is helpful to establish a daily formal meditation practice. Meditation often involves sitting and bringing one's attention to the present moment for a period of time. There are 
            several variations of the practice that use different techniques to develop mindfulness. Visit the <a href="one.html">Meditation</a> page to learn more.
            <br>
            Other ways to develop mindfulness include practising gratitiude, applying the Noble Eightfold Path (No, you do not need to be a Buddhist!), and thoughtfully consuming media. These three topics are covered
            in detail on the <a href="one.html">Mindful Living Practices</a> page.
